1. Prerequisites

   A Java 8+ JRE or JDK
   To install a JDK on Windows, download the x64 installer or ziped archive from the official Oracle
   website or OpenJDK website, run Setup and configure the JAVA_HOME environment variable and add
   %JAVA_HOME%\bin to the Path variable. If all goes well, you can run "java -version" from any command
   prompt. The latest JDK-25 works well.
  
2. Installation and Removing

   If you got the program as a Zip-Archive, unzip it into an empty Folder. Drag the Jar file onto your
   Desktop, while pressing the Alt-Key, to create a link there. Take care that you don't move or copy
   the file. Open the Properties of the Link. On the Link-Tab you can choose the icon of the Application
   directory. The Application itself don't make any use of your Registry. If you wish the removing, just
   delete the directory, included files and link on the desktop.

   This is a Pre-Release, so not all MusicBrainz Functions are supported. The Application should run
   on any Plattform, where a Java 8+ Runtime is available. This includes Linux's, Mac's , Unix's,
   Windows.
   Start the program. Copy a valid Artist-MBID from MusicBrainz website using ctrl-c and paste it into
