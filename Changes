Version                                   Changes
0.01      First public Pre-View
0.02      Pre-View                        Corrected a bug in english Locale
0.03      Pre-View                        Changed the names in the Properties file. Delete LibraryTag.prp if available.
                                          Added 3 new properties. MB.Limit sets the limit of lookup requests, default is 100.
                                          LibraryTag.Update [ true/false ] is the major switch for updating library.
                                          LibraryTag.Basedir is the position of the library. For Windows for example it should
                                          be "c\:\\", which is an escaped string for c:\. For Linux/Unixes the dafault is "/".
