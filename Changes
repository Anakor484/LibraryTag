0.02      Pre-View 0.02                   Corrected a bug in english Locale
0.03      Pre-View 0.03                   Changed the names in the Properties file. Delete LibraryTag.prp if available.
                                          Added 4 new properties. MB.Limit sets the limit of lookup requests, default is 100.
                                          LibraryTag.Update [ true/false ] is the major switch for acessing the library.
                                          LibraryTag.Basedir is the position of the library. For Windows for example it can
                                          be "c:\". For Linux/Unixes the dafault is "/".
                                          LibraryTag.RW [ro/rw] sets wether the library access should be readonly or readwrite.
                                          Added searching for files, but readonly access.
                                          Changed Readme to point out to LibraryTag.prp

                                          Added support for FlatLightLaf and FlatDarkLaf. Both can be set in the properties.
                                          Added Help with 4 help files for general help, properties file, howto, changes.
                                          I removed support FlatLaf, because of native libraries. Added theme for Metal. Added new
                                          images für buttons. Going now ahead with get reading tags from library.
                                          Removed KeyListener in the main Window, added KeyBinding for F1 key.
