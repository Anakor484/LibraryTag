                                          LibraryTag.Update [ true/false ] is the major switch for acessing the library.
                                          LibraryTag.Basedir is the position of the library. For Windows for example it can
                                          be "c:\". For Linux/Unixes the dafault is "/".
                                          LibraryTag.RW [ro/rw] sets wether the library access should be readonly or readwrite.
